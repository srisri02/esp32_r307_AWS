Biometric authentication is a process of identifying an individual based on unique
physiological or behavioral characteristics. The biometric data captured can be in
the form of fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or other unique traits. In a
traditional biometric authentication system, the biometric data is stored locally on
the user's device or on a server in a secure location. However, with the rise of
cloud computing, there is a growing trend towards using cloud-based biometric
authentication systems.

In such a system, the biometric data is encrypted before it is transmitted to the
cloud server, where it is securely stored. Encryption helps to protect sensitive
biometric data from unauthorized access, as even if the data is intercepted, it will
be unreadable without the encryption key.

We Propose to design a device using IoT,to which the user provides their
biometric data, which is then compared to the encrypted data stored in the cloud.
If the data matches, the user is authenticated, and the results of the authentication
process are transmitted back to the device, allowing them to access the desired
service or resource

In conclusion, the use of a cloud-based biometric authentication system can
provide secure and efficient access to services and resources for users, while also
enhancing security by protecting sensitive biometric data through encryption and
secure cloud storage
